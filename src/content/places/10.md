86% of the world's lakes are covered by ice for at least part of the year. However, lakes are undergoing profound changes as a result of climate change. The thickness of lake ice is set to decrease, while freshwater will be subject to an increased input of allochthonous organic matter due to increased water connectivity and anthropogenic activity. Microorganisms play key roles in Arctic lake ecosystems, where they are the most abundant organisms. However, little is known about ice microbial communities and how ice and water microbiomes respond to environmental change. The research project in this thesis aims to further characterize Arctic lake microorganisms in order to fill the knowledge gap on their activities and adaptation to climate disruption. DNA and RNA extracted from the samples will be analyzed using bioinformatics tools. The results of this project will shed light on the taxonomic diversity and gene expression of Arctic lake microbiomes. This will enable us to better anticipate changes linked to global warming in these ecosystems, and to develop future strategies for preventing or adapting to these changes.
